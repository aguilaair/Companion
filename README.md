A simple app to make Flutter development more delightful. Works on all major desktop platforms including MacOS, Windows and Linux. Please check the releases page for pre-built binaries.
Based on [Leo Faria's Sidekick](https://github.com/leoafarias/sidekick)

This app allows you to install, manage and view all of your flutter versions (managed by FVM). Additionally, it has the following features:
- Allows you to remove unused FVM versions
- View packages used in your projects
